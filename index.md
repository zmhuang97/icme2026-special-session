## <span style="color:#333;">Generative AI and Agents for Multimedia Coding, Processing, and Evaluation</span>

## 🔹 Overview

The landscape of multimedia is undergoing a paradigm shift driven by the convergence of Generative AI (e.g., diffusion models, autoregressive LLMs) and Agentic Systems (e.g., tool-using, planning, and multi-agent collaboration). These technologies are fundamentally reshaping the methodology of visual data compression, processing, and evaluation. Traditional signal processing is evolving toward model-centric paradigms, where large models serve as powerful priors for ultra-low bitrate coding, and autonomous agents orchestrate complex workflows ranging from narrative creation to system optimization. However, bridging the gap between "generation" and "practical application" poses critical challenges in computational efficiency, fine-grained controllability, and reliability. This session aims to align AI advancements with the practical requirements of multimedia systems.

## 🔹 Topics of Interest

**Representative topics include, but are not limited to:**

- **Generative Coding & Processing**: Leveraging diffusion models and LLMs for reconstruction, enhancement, and next-generation compression.
- **Agentic Media Workflows**: Orchestrating multi-agent systems for coherent narrative generation, cinematic control, and autonomous pipeline management.
- **Efficient Representations**: Investigating semantics-aware tokens, optimized prompts, and cross-modal embeddings to accelerate inference and transmission.
- **Evaluation & Benchmarking**: Developing metrics for perceptual quality, fine-grained controllability (e.g., emotional accuracy), and safety in AI-generated content.

## 🔹 Motivation

Modern multimedia systems increasingly rely on **large models** to interpret, synthesize, and reason about multimodal content. However, current coding frameworks primarily transmit **raw visual signals**, leading to:

- High redundancy  
- Mismatch with downstream model inference  
- Inefficiency in multi-agent or edge–cloud scenarios  

This session brings together researchers to rethink multimedia coding by leveraging **semantic priors**, **token-based representations**, **generative models**, and **agentic control mechanisms**.
