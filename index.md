## <span style="color:#333;">Generative AI and Agents for Multimedia Coding, Processing, and Evaluation</span>

---

## 🔹 Overview

The rapid development of **foundation models**, **generative AI**, and **agentic multimedia systems** is reshaping how multimedia is coded, transmitted, and interpreted. Traditional pixel-oriented pipelines incur redundancy and inefficiency when interfacing with model-based inference.  
This Special Session aims to explore **model-aware**, **semantic-aware**, and **agent-driven** multimedia coding paradigms that align compression with modern intelligent systems.

## 🔹 Topics of Interest

This special session welcomes submissions on (but not limited to):

- Generative model–aware image/video coding  
- Latent/token compression for LLMs and VLMs  
- Agentic multimedia pipelines across edge–cloud  
- Semantic communication & coding for machine  
- Representation alignment for vision–language models  
- AIGC reconstruction, enhancement, and transformation  
- Multi-agent perception, communication, and coordination  
- Evaluation methodology for model-aware codecs

## 🔹 Motivation

Modern multimedia systems increasingly rely on **large models** to interpret, synthesize, and reason about multimodal content. However, current coding frameworks primarily transmit **raw visual signals**, leading to:

- High redundancy  
- Mismatch with downstream model inference  
- Inefficiency in multi-agent or edge–cloud scenarios  

This session brings together researchers to rethink multimedia coding by leveraging **semantic priors**, **token-based representations**, **generative models**, and **agentic control mechanisms**.
